This is an Ergonomic PSeudo SPlit 75-key Keyboard. It was desinged after two years of working with a <a href="https://trulyergonomic.com/">Truly Ergonomic CLEAVE Keyboard</a> and also inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard">Redox Keyboard</a>.

<p>
This keyboard is designed to work with the layouts of the <a href="https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/">Neo Family</a> and the <a href="https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/reneo/" target="RENEO">ReNeo</a> software.
</p>
<p>
The firmware was created using <a href="https://github.com/qmk" target="QMK">QMK</a>. See also the files in the <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/epssp75" target="QMK">QMK Repo</a>.
But I am still using the <a href="https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/reneo/" target="RENEO">ReNeo</a> software.
And the ReNeo software offers more possible key functions and in total six layers.
The file containing the used layout to define those layers can be found <a href="https://github.com/hen-des/epssp75/reneo" target="Repo">here</a>.
